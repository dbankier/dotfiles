# My Dotfiles

It's a terminal thing. You really want to know?

## Prerequisites

I used these to kick start

- [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
  can be installed: `brew install tmux`
- [tmuxinator](https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator)
  `gem install tmuxinator`

## Install

- clone the repo so the contents end up in `~/dotfiles`
- run the install script: `cd dotfiles && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`

## Other bits

I haven't included the tmuxinator config as they are (private) project
specific. The `tmux.conf` is not very interesting and put together by
googling. My zsh theme is a modification of an existing one, but I don't
remember which.
